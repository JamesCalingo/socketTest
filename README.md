This is mainly just me trying to learn how to create a chatroom with Socket.io, but I just realized that it's also a digital way to play the Game of Things without using a bunch of paper!

# The Game of Things and how it works
The Game of Things is a party game where one player gets a prompt which is usually "Things..." and then something like "...that you shouldn't say when meeting a politician". The other players then write down answers to the prompt anonymously, and then they are given to the one player. Everyone then has to guess who wrote what.

Because chats in the app can be kept anonymous, it's possible to run this game as an app on its own as opposed to just using a messenger app, since most common messaging systems:

* have usernames displayed
* require 1 to 1 messaging to keep things anonymous, which causes chaos

# The future for this app
I believe there is a way for there to be a "master" user so that the answers aren't broadcast to all of the players, and also to have the "master" user broadcast the responses to all. I will work on implementing these in the future.
